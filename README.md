# Data-Analyst-Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Analyst Portfolio!

I am a data analyst with experience in using various tools and technologies to collect, organize, and analyze data to inform business decisions. I am proficient in Python, R, SQL, Excel, Power BI, and Tableau, and have a solid understanding of data analytics techniques such as dashboard building, report writing, data mining, data merging, statistics, and critical thinking.

In this portfolio, I have included a variety of projects that showcase my data analytics skills. You will find links of the dashboards and reports I have created using various tools such as Power BI, Tableau, and Excel. These projects demonstrate my ability to analyze and present data in a clear and visually appealing way, making it easy for decision makers to understand the insights and take action.

I have also included my work in programming languages such as Python, SQL and R. These projects showcase my ability to extract valuable insights from large and complex data sets, and to combine data from multiple sources to create a comprehensive view of the data.

In addition to my technical skills, I also pride myself on my critical thinking and problem-solving abilities. I am able to approach data analysis with a strategic mindset, and to identify key issues and opportunities in the data.

I am confident that my data analytics skills and experience make me an ideal candidate for any data analyst role. I hope you find my portfolio to be informative and engaging, and I welcome any opportunity to discuss my qualifications further with you.

Thank you for your time, I look forward to hearing from you soon.

## Portfolio Projects
In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

### Store Purchase Analysis
**Code:** [`Store Purchase analysis`](https://github.com/terrytning/Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/Store%20Purchase%20Analysis.ipynb)


**Goal:** To determine what factors contribute the most to a success.

**Description:** The project focused on analyzing a dataset of movies released between 1980 and 2022. The dataset included movie titles, ratings, genres, release dates, budgets, gross earnings, and other relevant information. The project involved loading the data, cleaning and preprocessing it, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), analyzing the correlation between budget and gross earnings, and implemented Pearson’s correlation statistical analysis.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, correlation matrices, hypothesis testing, data visualization.

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, SciPy.

**Results:** Using Python functions the analysis revealed that votes and budget have the highest correlation with gross earnings, while the company has no significant correlation.

### Customer Churn prediction

**Goal:** To examine the sales history of the store and extract insights on its performance, as well as to identify potential improvements that can be implemented.

**Code:** [`Customer churn prediction`](https://github.com/terrytning/Portfolio-Projects/blob/946ae39dec0d72644fdecf518fdc71db51bef261/Customer%20Churn%20Prediction%20Model.ipynb)


**Description:** The dataset contains a list of sales records.  The records include the products for sale and order information(order id, order date, price, quantity ordered and purchase address). The project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning and preprocessing, EDA (exploratory data analysis), analyzing sales data and hypothesis testing.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, hypothesis testing, data visualization.

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib.

**Results:** Python functions that calculated and visually presented the sales data by month, city, and the most commonly sold items. Additionally, the reasons for the high frequency of these items being sold were analyzed and provided as insights.



### Customer segmentation - RFM analysis
**Code:** [`Customer Segmentation RFM`](https://github.com/terrytning/Portfolio-Projects/blob/946ae39dec0d72644fdecf518fdc71db51bef261/Data%20Analysis.sql)

**Description:** The dataset contains a list of houses that have been sold in Nashville between 2013 and 2019. This project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning and preprocessing.


**Skills:** DML(Data Manipulation Language), DQL (Data Query Language), DDL (Data Definition Language).

**Technology:** SQL Server


### Amazon review sentiment analysis
**Code:** [`Amazon Review Sentimentl`](https://github.com/terrytning/Portfolio-Projects/blob/946ae39dec0d72644fdecf518fdc71db51bef261/sentiment%20analysis%20on%20Amazon%20reviews%20(1).ipynb)



**Description:** The dataset contains records of Covid-19 cases, deaths and vaccine records by country in 2020-2021. This project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning and preprocessing and EDA (exploratory data analysis).

**Skills:** Joins, CTE's, Temp Tables, Windows Functions, Aggregate Functions, Creating Views, Converting Data Types

**Technology:** SQL Server


### Legendary Pokémon Analysis

**Goal:** To predict Pokémon status based on their characteristics and rank their importance in determining whether a Pokémon is classified as legendary.

**Code:** [`Legendary Pokémon Analysis (Study Project)`](https://github.com/terry/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Legendary%20Pok%C3%A9mon%20Analysis.ipynb)

**Description:** The dataset contains a list of  Pokémon.  The records include their characteristics such as attack, defense, type and size. The project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning EDA (exploratory data analysis), analyzing characteristics of different Pokémon.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization.

**Technology:** Tidyverse
