# Data-Analyst-Portfolio 

Welcome to my Data Analyst Portfolio! 

I am a passionate and driven aspiring data analyst with a keen interest in uncovering insights from data and turning them into actionable strategies. Currently, I am on an exciting journey of self-learning, delving into the world of data analysis to master the skills and techniques that will enable me to make a significant impact in the field. 

Over the past few months, I have dedicated myself to learning various data analysis tools and programming languages including Python, SQL, Excel, Tableau and Power BI. By exploring online courses, tutorials, and projects, I am continually expanding my understanding of data visualization, statistical analysis, and data-driven decision-making. 

My self-learning journey has taught me the importance of persistence, problem-solving, decisiion making and critical thinking. I am not only focused on acquiring technical skills but also on developing a strong analytical mindset that will allow me to approach challenges with creativity and precision. 

I am confident that my data analytics skills and experience make me an ideal candidate for any data analyst role. I hope you find my portfolio to be informative and engaging, and I welcome any opportunity to discuss my qualifications further with you. 

Thank you for your time, I look forward to hearing from you soon. 

## Portfolio Projects 

In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases. 

### Store Purchase Analysis 

**Code:** [`Store Purchase analysis`](https://github.com/terrytning/Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/Store%20Purchase%20Analysis.ipynb) 

**Goal:** Gain insight on a stores customer purchase behaviour to determine what factors contribute the most to the company's success 

**Description:** The project focused on analyzing a dataset of purchases from a store between 3 different branches. The dataset included product line, unit price, total cost, payment type and other relevant information. The project involved loading the data, cleaning and preprocessing it, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data vizualization. 

**Skills:** Data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization 

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, SciPy. 

### Customer Churn Prediction 

**Code:** [`Customer churn prediction`](https://github.com/terrytning/Portfolio-Projects/blob/946ae39dec0d72644fdecf518fdc71db51bef261/Customer%20Churn%20Prediction%20Model.ipynb) 

**Goal:** Build a prediction model to predict the possibility of a customer churning for a telecom company 

**Description:** The dataset contains detailed customer information from a telecom company such as age, gender, tenure, monthly chargers, internet type and more. The project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning and preprocessing, defining features and target columns encoding categorical data, normalizing numeric data, splitting traning and testing data, looping through various model types (to determine which model has the highest accuracy), fitting and testing the model and finally vizualizing the model using a confusion matrix. 

 **Skills:** Data cleaning, data analysis, machine learning modelling process, data visualization 

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Numpy, Seaborn, Sklearn 

### Customer Segmentation - RFM Analysis 

**Code:** [`Customer Segmentation RFM`](https://github.com/terrytning/Portfolio-Projects/blob/946ae39dec0d72644fdecf518fdc71db51bef261/Data%20Analysis.sql) 

**Goal:** Identify and better understand segments of customers 

**Description:** The dataset contains customer purchase transactions, including customer name, purchase date, amount purchased, etc. This project requires data loading, data cleaning and preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), calculating recency, frequency and monetary value (RFM) of customer orders, grouping customers by their RFM and using it to obtain an RFM value and lastly using the RFM value to interpret cutomer segments. 

**Skills:** Data cleaning, data manipulation, exploratory data analysis (EDA), RFM segmentation 

**Technology:** SQL Server 

 ### Amazon Review Sentiment Analysis 

**Code:** [`Amazon Review Sentimentl`](https://github.com/terrytning/Portfolio-Projects/blob/946ae39dec0d72644fdecf518fdc71db51bef261/sentiment%20analysis%20on%20Amazon%20reviews%20(1).ipynb) 

**Goal:** Analyze customer reeviews to determine the overall sentiment towards an Amazon product 

**Description:** The dataset contains records of reviews from a company operating on Amazon in the home textiles and everyday clothing sectors. This project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning, text preprocessing (lowercase conversion, removal of punctuation, numerical exressions and stopwords, tokenization and lemmatization), determining the frequency of a word, plotting word frequency using a bar chart and word cloud and finally calculating the polarity score. 

**Skills:** Data cleaning, data manipulation, data vizualization 

 **Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Textblob, Wordcloud, NLTK 


### Project 5, Tableau Public Dashboard

**Goal:** To create a dashboard showing key perfromance indicators of sales in a company.

**Code:** [`Legendary Pokémon Analysis (Study Project)`](https://github.com/terry/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Legendary%20Pok%C3%A9mon%20Analysis.ipynb)

**Description:** The dataset contains a list of  Pokémon.  The records include their characteristics such as attack, defense, type and size. The project includes the following steps: data loading, data cleaning EDA (exploratory data analysis), analyzing characteristics of different Pokémon.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization.

**Technology:** Tableau Public
